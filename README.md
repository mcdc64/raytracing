# raytracing
A project to implement a raytracing algorithm in Python.

To create a scene, define objects in raytracing.py and add them to the "objects" list. Then run raytracing.py.
If using textures, make sure the path for the one you want to use is correct. Texture mapping currently is only supported for planes.
